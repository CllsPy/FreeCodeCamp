## What i've learnt
Iâ€™ve learned a ton about machine learning and its practical uses, especially for projects or work. In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, I got hands-on experience using TensorFlow to build neural networks and apply advanced techniques like natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning. It was great to explore how these techniques are used in real-world applications like chatbots and recommendation systems.
