## What i've learnt
I’ve learned a ton about machine learning and its practical uses, especially for projects or work. In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, I got hands-on experience using TensorFlow to build neural networks and apply advanced techniques like natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning. It was great to explore how these techniques are used in real-world applications like chatbots and recommendation systems.

## Machine Learning With Python Certification

Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job.

In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.

## Courses

### TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easier to use.

The following video course was created by Tim Ruscica, also known as “Tech With Tim”. It will help you to understand TensorFlow and some of its powerful capabilities.

### How Neural Networks Work
Neural networks are at the core of what we call artificial intelligence today. But historically they've been hard to understand. Especially for beginners in the machine learning field.

Even if you are completely new to neural networks, these video courses by Brandon Rohrer will get you comfortable with the concepts and the math behind them.

### Machine Learning with Python Projects
Machine learning has many practical applications. By completing these free and challenging coding projects, you will demonstrate that you have a good foundational knowledge of machine learning, and qualify for your Machine Learning with Python certification.
